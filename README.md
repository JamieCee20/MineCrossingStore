## User Functionality

<p>
    The user point of view is to browse and purchase items from the store that would equivalate to in-game items.
    You can browse the store as a guest then upon checking out, you can continue as guest or sign in/create an account which allows you to follow your past orders under your account.

    If you continue as guest, you will receive an email confirmation of your purchase, but if you chose to sign up for an account, you can follow the orders in the orders tab of my account. You can also edit your email and name as well as password if needed.

    The admin user role has the ability to view all orders placed along with checking completed and failed purchases. Along with this, they can add new products to the store, remove old products and create new categories in the line of new product ranges.

    The admin user is also able to purchase items such as a normal user can which doesn't stop the admin from having standard user functionality.
